Just a scratch of a project that can become really big.

At the moment it just runs a container that boots up a python file which will get a random image of a dog.

Objetives:
  Create a server that boots up containers for generic applications from the clients browsers
  Create a useful application for the server to run
  Run the applications directly in the server and just stream the frontend to the clients
  Integrate it with SUAP
  Make a cluster-computer that will run it smoothly

Study topics:
  Linux terminal, how it works and how can I use it for the project
  APIs in general
  Containers, Docker and Kubernets
  RTP(Real-Time-Protocol)
  How to setup a cluster

  App. ideas:
  PPI app for the 4th graders
